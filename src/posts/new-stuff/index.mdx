This stage was a true sufferfest of a stage. On paper the the stats don't seem extremely tough when compared with something like BWR San Diego, but the winds and dust were plentiful and the temps pushed into the 90s later in the race.

This stage was a true sufferfest of a stage. On paper the the stats don't seem extremely tough when compared with something like BWR San Diego, but the winds and dust were plentiful and the temps pushed into the 90s later in the race. The stage starts with a longer climb and I was able to push hard and get into a good position (26min @ 268watts).
