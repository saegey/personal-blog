1. Origin & Spark
	•	When did the idea first hit you?
		- I started vinyl selecting last year and the first step was trying to keep my library up to date in Discogs. We all know how hard it is to keep track of our vinyl collection, especially when you have a lot of records. Discogs has a feature called "folders" that allows you to organize your collection, but it doesn't really help you with the actual selection process and each vinyl can only be in one folder which also kinda sucks. But nonetheless, I used this and flipping through the folders is a similar process and flipping through your vinyl in person. I prefer bins for vinyl instead of shelves because this process lends itself to a more tactile experience and its easier to see and there is probably a reason most vinyl shops have this layout. I have genre'ish dividers in my bins (Uhaul heavy duty boxes for now) and I wanted to create a digital tool that mirrored this physical experience but without the limitations of Discogs. I love the platform but it hard to be good in everything and their marketplace seems to be where most of their focus is. I wanted to create a tool that would allow me to organize my collection in a way that made sense for me and my workflow as a DJ. I also wanted to be able to discover new music and find records that I might have forgotten about. There is also the common problem (way more frequent for diggers) that the music is available on streaming services. When thats the case the playlist creation process is very manual (sampling tracks and piecing them together in to a cohesive playlist) which can be fun but is a huge time suck and not for everybody. Also there is the option of just winging it but this is not my style and as a newbie selector, could result in some embarrasing situations.
	•	Was it after a frustrating crate-digging session, a particular DJ gig, or a conversation with someone?
		- yeah pretty much my friend and I had this problem where we couldn't really browse our library unless at home or through Discogs (lacked the features we needed) and even potentially collaborating the problem gets even worse. I have apple music and he spotify.
	•	What was the exact problem you wanted to solve first?
		- search by tracks by their specifc genere not the album's genres it contains. Find other tracks that are similar to another or playlist. export and save playlists. Easily sample music with buffering and waits. Not losing catalog because streaming services lose rights. Ordering playlist with cohesion are intended energy. Being able to collaborate with others and add their library for borrowing purposes if they have some fire tracks that could complete a playlist.

2. Building It
	•	Did you start with the tech in mind or the workflow in mind?
		- not really, but early on i found meilisearch and it looked like a great fit. I had done some big indexes on elasticsearch a while ago and it was a pain and the query syntax was not very intuitive. Meilisearch is a lot more intuitive and has a great API. I also knew I wanted to use the Discogs API to get the data for my collection, so I started there. I also wanted to use the Apple Musickit API to match with discogs if possible and export back to apple music since was post playlists for Public Vinyl Radio
	•	Were there any unexpected challenges or “oh no” moments while building it?
		- yeah, i haven't always been a fan of the added complexity of Docker. It still runs shitty on Mac os x  but in this case. I needed a way to run meilliesearch, postgres vector, essentia, and scipy all together, and Docker seemed like the best option. I currently have it running in portainer on an old intel nuc that is leftover from Home assistant. It feels cool to be running it at home on my own hardware and not in the cloud. I little bit similar to have all the vinyls at my house in my possesion. unless someone comes and takes them or a disaster happens they are mine and not at the disposal of a large corporation that provides streaming. I also had no idea how the recommedations would come out. But once I loaded my library from discogs to the search index it was already better than I expected that was without enriching the data from chatGpt and analyzing the audio.
	•	What was the first milestone where you thought, this is actually going to work?
		When the recommendations where good enough I knew I was on to something. I was able to find tracks that I had forgotten about and create playlists that were cohesive and had a good flow. I also started to see the potential for collaboration with other DJs and selectors.

3. The Vinyl/DJ Angle
	•	How does this app change how you prepare a set today compared to before?
		- I search for a key track and scroll through the recommendations and preview tracks. As I add more to the playlist the recommendations get better and better. I can also search by genre and find tracks that I might have forgotten about. I can also listen to the playlist on the go via Cloudfront tunnel and auth.
	•	Is there a story of a set where this tool saved the day or made you play something you wouldn’t have otherwise?
	  - Yes, I just posted one to youtube that I used this tool to prepare for. It also enabled me to export the playlist to json and use that to build my blog post and apple music playlist. It even helped get the track cue points on a youtube comment. It outputs a PDF in format designed for the live set so I use the printout while peforming the set.

4. The Nerdy Details
	•	Which piece of tech or algorithm are you most proud of in this build?
	    - I learned about greedy algorithm and genetic during this which seemed familar but not something I have done before. The embedded vectors and semantic search that is also new to me and very applicable to lots of other projects. 
	•	Was there a moment where you had to get creative to make two systems “talk” that normally wouldn’t?
	    - Not really, docker really facilited this and one page python api's for microservices keep things pretty lean. I did have to deal with lots of frontend refactor after vibe coding the first week pretty much. I had lots of boilerplate and duplicate in my APIs and frontend components but I was able to streamline things significantly by creating reusable components, hooks and providers. There is always going to be some of this in any fast moving project but I feel that overall the architecture has held up well. As a senior engineer but who loves product being able to move fast and not get distracting by the goal of perfect code is important. I also keep the code in Github where everyone can see it and that keeps me a little more honest about the quality of the code.

5. Future Vision
	•	If you had unlimited time/resources, what’s the dream version of this app?
		- I envision this as way to use your vinyl collection as a dynamic, interactive library that not only helps you find and organize your records but also suggests new ways to experience them — like creating unique mashups or discovering hidden gems based on your listening habits. Being able to cancel streaming and have a local-first experience with my vinyl collection is the ultimate goal. I'm not sure the value for someone not playing sets but I think there is still a lot of potential for casual listeners to discover new music and engage with their collections in a more meaningful way.
	•	Do you want to keep it personal or eventually release it for other vinyl DJs?
		- It's open source and I would love to see other people use it. I think it could be a great tool for DJs and selectors to discover new music and organize their collections. I also think it could be a great way for people to engage with their vinyl collections in a more meaningful way. I would love to see other people contribute to the project and help make it better. My friend Ben is running it on his primary laptop and he has been giving me feedback on the features he would like to see. Even though we are using algorithms to enhance experience. Your are ultimately in control of them so eventually the software can be used to create a unique experience that is tailored to your personal taste and workflow. I think this is the future of music discovery and I want to be a part of it.
