teaser: Flowy desert trails with no much climbing make for a fast and exciting race but with a few challenges.
---

After seeing the photos from this race from last year, I really wanted to race this
course. It is so different than our lush forest and loamy brown dirt trails in the
western foothills of the Cascades. It is proper sage desert riding with loose, dusty,
sandy and rocky trails. The race was originally scheduled for another weekend and
I was already planning to race Ephrata Gran Fondo so two trips to central Washington
didn't seam feasible but it was rescheduled to the day before Ephrata and it was
an easy decision to head out early to race both days.
