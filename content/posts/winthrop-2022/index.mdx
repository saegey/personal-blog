As soon as I found out a friend of mine was registered for this race back in August I decided I was going to register for it. I was hoping for some residual fitness since I finished RPI Stage race about two weeks before. I thought about doing this one last year but it was actually relocated from Winthrop to Soap Lake due to the fires last year.

I played it naive and didn't pay much attention to what the route looked like for this one till a few weeks before. I assumed lots of climbing but when I finally opened up RWGPS and peeped the elevation profile I realized it was going to be a true sufferfest. Two giant climbs back to back and more elevation than I have ever done in around 90 miles.

As daunting as the numbers are, for some reason the long climbs are my jam these days and since you can usually just get more comfortable with the consistent output and settle in too a pain threshold you can handle for a while. I have had plenty of practice this year but just nothing this long. I have rode hard tempos on Paradise, Sunrise, Kachess, and others all this summer and they have gone overall well.

The temperature at 8am was cold so I opted to start with a shake dry jacket and medium gloves. It was time to ditch the jacket after around 25 min into ride after hitting the base of the climb which starts as pavement. I probably would choose a vest next time. The zipper on my 7mesh jacket is not easiest to use when riding so I pulled over for probably 15 secs to take it off. Before this is when we ran into the cattle that were crossing the road. The gloves were a good choice though and left them on the entire ride. At higher altitudes on the climb the temperature was lower and the gloves helped keep my hands warm.
