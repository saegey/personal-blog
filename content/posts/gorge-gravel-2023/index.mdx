This race has been on my list from since last year and is a great early season fitness builder.  It attracts strong fields with its close proximity to Seattle and Portland.  The first time riding in this area was last fall where we rode the [OMTM Japanese Hollow](http://www.omtm.cc/japanese-hollow) route and attempted [OMTM Swale Canyon](http://www.omtm.cc/swalecanyon80) but we had to re-route due to fire danger.

From my memory, the gravel in this area is good with very little car traffic and can fit in the category of "luxury" gravel.  I consider "luxury" gravel to be a smooth enough surface it can be ridden with wider road tires and is quite close to paved.  It is also devoid of potholes and washboards that also can make a ride much less enjoyable.

The prepartion the day before was mixed for this race. I was in bed and asleep early (8:35pm) and slept a solid 8 hours 20 minutes.  I brought my usual premade, steel cut oatmeal with sliced almonds, blueberries and maple syrup and ate as much as a could after waking up.  I had a hearty meal in The Dalles the night before of hawaiian bbq (chicken, rice, mac salad) at [Lilo's](https://www.lilosbbq.com/).

But the bad was we missed packet pick up by an hour or so.  We had to pick up our packet (number plate, timing chip, etc) the morning of and the line was long.  Ira and I spent an hour waiting in line so by the time we parked, we had about 15 minutes to get ready.  The mistakes compounded because I just squeezed my tires and determined they were good and at the final moment decided to wear a winter long sleeve jersey instead of my planned summer weight short sleeve.  All these mistakes will end up causing havoc for me later in the race.

The first big effort of the day was a 200 foot kicker climb the whole feel smashed up.  I averaged 377 watts for 2:10 seconds which felt good because the legs were fresh for the day. Up to that point, it was an easy 119 watt average for first 10 min of the neutral roll out.  The race pretty much starts at this climb but they actually stopped everyone for 2 min at a start line.  Then there is a short descent and the next longer climb begins.  This climb breaks up the field into a lot of different groups.  Ira and I were riding together from the start and following each other wheels but during this climb we linked up with our friend [Alec](https://www.strava.com/activities/8945730124) and [Vincente](https://www.strava.com/activities/8945965055).

I was feeling really good on the climb. The climb was around 1,300 feet and I had a normalized power of 276 watts for about 31 minutes.  I did a lot of turns on the front trying to push the pace because the riders in front of us were gaining distance and you don't want to fall too far back.  I find that getting in a strong group earlier and just trying to hang on gives you a better chance of a good finish versus a slower start and trying to gain places over the race.

The riders you link up with in the pointier part of the field typically have better fitness so the groups hold a higher speed. It can be a little scary because you worry about going to hard and totally blowing up but some of this is remembering to eat and drink so you can sustain a hard pace.

This is my second race using a hydration pack.  I have the Osprey 1.5 liter pack and had two 26 oz bottles onboard.  They were are filled with [GU Roctane Energy Drink Mix](https://guenergy.com/products/roctane-energy-drink-mix?variant=39247233908787). I also had around 9 GU energy gels in my jersey and was trying to consume one every hour of the race.  I had consumed around 60 grams per hour in the Grand Fondo Ephrata and the last hour was pretty brutal for me and I assume it was somewhat related to fueling.  So if I had a two gel every hour and a bottle every hour an half I would be around 80 grams per hour.  The plan was to not stop at any aid stations the entire day to save time.

      The neutral roll out from the town of Dufur. It was neutral till a short 180 ft, 10% climb that I averaged more than 350 watts to stay with the pointier end of the field. This was the biggest matched burned all day. Photo:{' '}

Once I reached the top of the climb, we were down to a group of about seven.  I noticed a buddy, Carter, that I had met in Sun Valley for Rebecca's Private Idaho had joined us from behind. This was super cool to be a in strong couple with three of my friends and thoughts were going through my head that we could last all day together.  There was a fast but gradual descent that lasted for 45 mins at an average speed of 24 miles per hour.  By the end of the descent our group had grown to somewhere around 25 and the amount of coordination had dropped considerably.  While we were a small group, we rotated through consistently in a paceline.  Once we balloned in numbers, there were a few racers to stay at the front the whole time and others just sitting on not contributing at all.

I had a few conversations with Ira and Vincente.

## The Good

1. Brand new 12 speed chain with silca wax treatment for race day
2. Bike and tires were great all day and no issues at all.
3. Effort for the first hour of the race was strong

## Needs Improvement

1. Planned for 60 grams of carb per hour and needed more. I was pretty depleted and really hungry by the beginning of the last climb and had two gels but I should have started with a gel per hour much earlier.
2. I was dropped on the 2nd descent of the race and burned too many matches trying to get back with them. I eventually realized that most of them would likely stop at the aid station because only a few had hydration packs. I should have made this call earlier and just waited for company from behind to face the wind.
