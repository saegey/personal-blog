1. Origin & Motivation
	•	When did the idea for Public Vinyl Radio first come to you?
	- It came find different vinyl shows on Youtube (My Analog Journal and Humanos Studios) where two that triggered the idea. I got into vinyl in 2017ish mostly from buying cheap records to find samples for music production that I was trying to get into. I ended getting a bunch from father from a trip to Florida that boosted my library. During the pandemic, i mostly just listened in our living room to some favorite album we had purchased new that found locally. Seattle has a lot of vinyl stores and maybe even more during this time (RIP Bop Street Records) and  lot of what I got was from Sonic Boom right in Ballard. My idea was to have a slightly different take then these two which both have dedicated studios. I am a fan of design, architecture and furniture. I observed that people tend to have friends or family at there homes less(anecdotal) and only via my observations in Seattle. What better than have a lenses into peoples home to show "how the live". There are many people that build there home over decades of thought how best to present the space and provide optimal value.
	•	Was there a specific event, conversation, or moment that made you decide to start it?
	  - A couple friends of mine and I were going to Cumbia de Muertos on Halloween. As dressed as Geogio Papadoulous from Ancient Aliens, I mentioned how cool it would be to create our own vinyl channel. Both friends are involved professionally in video and have strong vinyl collections so it seemed right.
	•	What gap in the DJ/music/culture space did you feel needed to be filled?
	  - We are provided a down to earth DIY approach to how to handle our creative process. No bougie $4k amplifiers or rare technics-mk2 in order to get started. I went analog rotary (Ecler 2) to keep in vintage though. We are trying to provide accessbility to discover music without having to pay a Patreon to join the "community". no cover charge type shit. We will play some rare vinyls from time to time but we also play lots of repress and we don't care. It's all vinyl. If someone likes a record, we want them to be able to buy it and not for $200. It doesn't have to be rare. We want to inspire people to go analog and buy some this music and get into their own shit. If we want to make money will do live shows or sell some merch. But to date pretty much all our merch has been made by us and is 1-1 pretty much.

2. The Vision
	•	What is the core mission of Public Vinyl Radio?
		- Create and vibe and bring happiness to the masses. Inspire people to find their inner artist.
	•	How do you want listeners/viewers to feel after watching a set?
	    - they feel connected. they like the logo and our style. we try to be unique and play what we feel. they like our space and the style we emit. we are cool as fuck. 
	•	Why is it important that it’s 100% vinyl?
	    - digital has no character. it's to perfect. we like to embrace the patina of life. we die in the end but the scars and determination gives that character that defines us.
	•	How do you define the “artistic movement” part — what makes it more than just a DJ channel?
	    - we dont follow a formula. we try to evolve and constant do something new. we don't ever want to be predictable or ordinary.

3. The Craft
	•	How do you approach vinyl selection for a set? Is there a theme, mood, or narrative process?
	    - yes there usually is a theme. A lot have been tropical (cumbia, salsa, afrobeat) but we can't wait till we can do variety mixes and play a broad set of genres. We aim to eventually get to a place where we cover a large breadth of styles of music. So much the United States is focus of north american artists and UK and there is a lot of great music out there. Personally, we are super into Latin and African music.
	•	What’s your workflow for filming and editing a set?
	    - we try to use different cameras. Mirrors, vintage lenses, go-pro, iphones, etc. The videos are edited by myself in Final Cut Pro. I try to use a lot of different angles and shots to keep it interesting. I also try to use a lot of different effects and transitions to keep it fresh. Ben, another involved party edits in Adobe Premiere Pro. He has a different style and we try to keep it fresh by using different styles of editing.
	•	Do you do your own photography and branding?
		- yes, we do our own photography and branding. We try to keep it simple and clean. We want the focus to be on the music and the vibe, not on the branding. I designed two logos, numerous prints, tshirts, hat designs, etc.  
	•	How do you make playlists accessible (e.g., tracklists, streaming links, blog posts)?
	    - we post the tracklists in the video description and on our website via a blog post. We also try to provide links to where people can buy the records or stream them. We want to make it easy for people to find the music we play and support the artists. We have apple music and spotify playlists that we update with the tracks for each set. We also have some older shit on Mixcloud but we didn't find much of an audience there.

4. The History Component
	•	How do you research and share the history of the music in your playlists?
	    - right now via a blog post but I would like to improve this process. I think incorporating more visual elements, like infographics or video snippets, could make the history more engaging. Right now, we just pull track information from chatgpt and compile it together.
	•	Is it part of the video, a blog post, or both?
	    - only on the blog post, the video is just music and no talking. We might do some talking shows discussing some favorite vinyls in the future though.
	•	Why is telling the history important to you?
	    - because its important so they can learn and appreciate the music more deeply. Understanding the context and background of a track can enhance the listening experience and push you in different directions to explore. Maybe they collaborated with someone you know or so forth.

5. Community & Accessibility
	•	Who do you want Public Vinyl Radio to reach — DJs, casual listeners, crate diggers, music historians?
		- we want to reach a diverse audience, including DJs looking for new material, casual listeners who enjoy discovering music, crate diggers who appreciate the art of vinyl, and music historians interested in the context behind the tracks. We would also eventually like to release our own vinyls of compilations so you can play our mixes in your home and be analog. Otherwise we are just promoting another streaming service now, Youtube. I think digital streaming should be last resort ( aka I'm running or in the car, airpline, etc)
	•	How do you see accessibility playing a role (e.g., multiple languages, easy-to-find playlists, cultural context)?
		- Accessibility is key. We want to make our content available in multiple languages, provide easy-to-find playlists, and include cultural context for the music we play. This way, people from different backgrounds can connect with the music and understand its significance. Right now we are only in English but we would like to have subtitles in Spanish and Portuguese. We are also working on a website that will have all the playlists and tracklists in one place, making it easier for people to find and explore our content.

6. Milestones & Highlights
	•	What has been your favorite set or moment so far on the channel?
	    - I think right now are favorite moments are playing live at Rapha Seattle in front of real people which is definitely a different experience than playing to a camera. The energy is just so much more intense and it's great to see people enjoying the music in real time. We have some improvements to our live setup in the works which will be exciting. Another favorite moment, is our Tropical Sunsets set that really found its audience and has done better than any of our other sets. It was a great mix of cumbia, salsa, and afrobeat that really resonated with people. We also had a lot of fun filming it and trying out different camera angles and effects.
	•	Any collaborations, events, or stories from filming that stand out?
		- Collaborating with Rapha is our biggest so far. We are starting to look for some brewery spaces or coffee spaces that will host our events and provide a more intimate setting for our performances.

7. Future Vision
	•	Where do you see Public Vinyl Radio in 3–5 years?
		- I see us as a well-known name in the vinyl community, with a strong following and a reputation for quality content. We want to expand our reach and collaborate with more artists and brands. We also want to release our own vinyl compilations and maybe even host our own events or festivals. We want a listening lounge and a physical space where people can come together to enjoy music, attend events, and connect with each other.
	•	Any plans for live events, collaborations, vinyl releases, or physical spaces?
	    - yes plans are listed on previous question
